# ChungleBot

## Getting Started
First off, make sure you have the following stuff installed:

 - [Python 3.7.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/)
 - [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 - [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)

In order to get the bot up and running, copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Now paste your bot token from the [Discord applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) page there.

More info coming soon!
